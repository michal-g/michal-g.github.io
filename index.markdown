I am a Research Software Engineer with the Pathways+Omics team at Oregon Health & Science University. My current work involves using machine learning algorithms to predict mutation states from expression data. Check out my gallery for examples of plots and analyses I've recently worked on at OHSU!

I completed my Bacholor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in 2013, graduating from the Honours in Combinatorics and Optimization program with a minor in History. As this was a co-op degree, over the course of six work semesters I had the opportunity to work in a wide variety of interesting positions, including analyzing census data of indigenous peoples for the Canadian federal government, optimizing automated call centre software for Nuance Communications, and exploring the genetic links between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto.

In my last two Waterloo co-op semesters I worked as a bioinformaticist in the former Boutros Lab at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research studying the properties of prognostic biomarkers in breast and non-small-cell lung cancer. This work carried over to my graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I obtained a Master of Science degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2016 before leaving for my current position at OHSU.
